<h1>Cardfight Vanguard</h1>
<img src="../finalproject/images/logo-circle.png" class="img-rounded img-responsive">
<p>Welcome to my webpage and in here I will help teach you how to play cardfight Vanguard. Cardfight vanguard is this new card game that is going on recently and in this card game the experience will be something you will enjoy.</p>

<div class="container-fluid section text-center fw" id="The benefits of learning">
<h2>The benefits of learning</h2>
<p>It can help you make lots of friends all around. Sometimes help you not worry on stress. Some people may not be a big fan of cardfighting but people need to try it out for themselves to understand it better. Even if you may not like it at least you tried it. Goodluck learning how to play and remember have fun!!</p>

<div class="container-fluid section text-center fw" id="The clans">
<h2>The clans</h2>
<p>A clan is the type of card of what that unit is to find out what clan are they from look at the bottom right. Its best to know this so you can build a deck based on that clan. If you build a deck made up of units from different clans you will have an unstable deck to work with.</p>
<div class="container-fluid section text-center fw" id="How to play">
<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>There are 6 circles in the front when you play. So to start the game each player needs to put a grade 0 in the middle of the circles. Then to start the game the players must say <bold>“Stand up Vanguard”</bold> and flip the card they placed in the middle face up. To decide on who goes first play rock paper scissors then the winner will decide to go first or second. A deck of 50 cards and a starting unit is what you need to play.</p>

<p>To start off the game each player draws 5 cards from their deck and if they don’t like any of the cards in their hand the player can put a number of cards back to the deck, shuffle and redraw the number of cards that were put in the deck. There is no limit to the number of cards you can have in your hand once you play through the entire game.
</p>

<li>The Grade</li>
<img src="../finalproject/images/BT01-S02EN_SP.jpg">
<p>In the game the cards we use are called units and each unit has a grade of 0,1,2, and 3. To see the grade of that unit look at the top left of the card.</p>

<li>How to deal damage</li>
<p>Attack the players middle circle or their vanguard circle to deal them damage during the battle phase. To attack turn the unit from vertical to horizontal position. Make sure your unit has a power greater than their vanguards power or equal to it. To see the power of that unit look at the bottom left of the card. Note when you attack that is when you can do a drive check.</p>

<li>The different types of Zones</li>
<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">
<img src="../finalproject/images/Cv_paperplaymat.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive">
    </div>
<p>The <bold>deck zone</bold> is where you put the deck. The damage zone is where you put the cards when you take damage. The <bold>drop zone</bold> in a zone where the cards you use to guard, send, or anything else go to that type of zone. The <bold>bind zone</bold> is a zone where cards that are removed go to. The <bold>trigger zone</bold> is where you reveal the top cards of your deck when you are doing your drive check & damage check. The <bold>G zone</bold> is a place where you have your grade 4s.
</p>
<li>The triggers</li><img src="../finalproject/images/trigger-feature2.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive">
<p>There are 4 types of triggers in Vanguard but your deck must have 16 triggers only so choose wisely and each trigger gives 5000 power. Always look at the top right of the card to see if you get the trigger. Critical trigger (the yellow) allows you to deal an extra damage to your opponent. You can also give a unit the critical while giving another unit the power boost of 5000. Draw tigger (the red)  allows you to draw an additional card from the deck. Heal trigger (the green) allows you to recover one damage from your damage from your damage zone as long as you have more damage then your opponent equal damage or your damage is equal. Stand trigger (the blue) allows you to stand up a unit in a rear-guard circle. Like the critical you can also give the power to another unit of your choice. </p>


<li>The drive check & damage check</li>
<p>These checks only happen during the battle phase when a player deals the other damage. The player who deals the damage to their opponent gets to do a drive check, that person can reveal the top card of their deck and add it to their hand. The Damage check is when you take damage reveal the top card of your deck and put it in the damage zone.
</p>

<li>The Rearguard circles</li>
<img src="../finalproject/images/1026998.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive">
<p>The Rearguard circles are circles around the vanguard circle and in those circles you can call units from your hand to the field but as long as there grade is equal to or less then the vanguard.</p>

<li>The units symbols</li>

<p>Every unit has a symbol on them that symbol can be seen on the top left of the card under their grade. The <bold>boost symbol</bold> only grades 0 and 1 can do where they can boost their power to another unit that is in front of them. For example a unit with 5000 + another with 7000 power makes 12000. The <bold>intercept symbol</bold> only grade 2s have it allows them to go in the guardian circle from the Rearguard circle in the front row. The twin drive symbol only grade 3s have but it only works if they are in the vanguard circle. The <bold>twin drive</bold> allows them to look at the two cards of your deck in a drive check during battle instead of one card.</p>

<li>The guardian circle</li>
<p>The guardian circle only works for the battle phase. When your opponent attacks you have the option to decide to guard their attack or not. The unit has a shield on the left side right near the middle of the card and you can use a unit from your hand that has that shield to protect you from there attack. Here is an example if there attack power is 10000, you have a 7000 power from your vanguard you can use a shield of 5000  and that will make your power into 12000 making it stronger then their attack to protect yourself.</p>

<li>The sentinel units</li>
<p>The sentinel units are another type of unit you can use for the guardian circle but you can only have 4 sentinels in a deck.</p>

<li>The skills</li>
<p>There those that have skills and those that don’t and here is what you need to know about how to use them. The <bold>Auto skill</bold> allows units to use that skill during battle or main phase.
The <bold>Active skill</bold> allows units to use the skill before the battle phase
The <bold>Continuous skill</bold> allows the unit to keep using that skill as long as that unit stays on the field.
The <bold>GB skills</bold> only work if there are face up G units in the G zone.
</p>
<div class="container">
<li>The types of icons</li>
<img src="../finalproject/images/BT01-S02EN_SP.jpg">
<p>Some units have icons that you need to do in order to use those skills.</p>
<p>Counter-blast (Purple color icon) is where you select a unit from the damage and flip it face down.</p>
<p>Soul-blast (The blue color icon) is when you remove a number of cards from the soul and send them to the drop zone. The soul is the number of cards that are under the current vanguard unit.</p>
<P>Counter-charge (Green color icon) is where you select a unit in the damage zone and flip it from face down to face up.</P>
<p>Soul-charge (Orange color icon) is where you put the top card or cards of your deck underneath the vanguard circle.</p>
</div>
<li>The G units</li>
<p>The G units are grade 4s but both players need to have grade 3 in the vanguard circle to use them. There power gets added from the vanguards power and takes the vanguards names as its own and makes it a heart. They have a symbol that allows them to reveal the top 3 cards of the deck, like any other check it only works during the battle phase. At the end of the turn put the G units you used back in the G zone face up. The <bold>G guardians</bold> are units that you can use only in the guardian circle, these units are for extra protection for your vanguard but to use them you need to send a heal trigger to the drop zone. </p>

<p>Note like other G units the those guardians also go into the G zone.</P>

<li>G assist</li>
<p>The G assist works only if you don’t have a card to ride on the vanguard during your ride phase. Show your hand to your opponent and look at the top 5 cards of your deck. Pick one unit that is one grade higher then your vanguard, remove two cards from your hand and two G units from the G zone once you do this.</p>
<div class="container-fluid section text-center fw" id="The 6 phases">
<h2>The 6 phases</h2>

<p>The <bold>Stand phase</bold> where the player can turn all the cards they have from horizontal position to vertical position. But if a player uses an effect to stop them from standing you do not stand it. The <bold>Draw phase</bold> where you can draw a card from the deck. The <bold>Ride phase</bold> when the player can place another unit in the middle circle also known as the vanguard as long as that unit is one grade. The <bold>Main phase</bold> where you can decide what to do with your cards in that phase. The <bold>Battle phase</bold> where you can attack the other players units with yours by turning them from vertical into horizontal position. The <bold>End phase</bold> in here the player ends their turn and then the other person will begin their turn.
